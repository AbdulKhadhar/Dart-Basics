# Flutter Notes

WHAT IS FLUTTER ?

Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop cross platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase
Flutter is not a programming language. It’s a software development kit (SDK) with prewritten code, consisting of ready-to-use and customizable widgets, as well as libraries, tools, and documentation that together serve to build cross-platform apps. Flutter’s language for cross-platform development is Dart, which was also developed by Google.
